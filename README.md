Use this script at your own risk!

From time to time it may be necessary to install a new [roon-on-wine](https://github.com/RoPieee/roon-on-wine) instance. For example, if a new .NET or Windows version is required after an updated version of [Roon](https://roonlabs.com).

This script should help to make the installation as easy as possible.

The following things are done:
* A backup of the directory `my_roon_instance` is created.
* A backup of the script `start_my_roon_instance.sh` is created.
* The latest version of [roon-on-wine](https://github.com/RoPieee/roon-on-wine) is installed.
* The previous Roon settings and the start script are restored.
